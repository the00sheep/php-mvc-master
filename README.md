# php-mvc-master

The application will have the following features:
- Add hotel
- Edit hotel
- Delete hotel (use soft delete)
- List hotels
- Filter hotel by name, city, country, price

For this application I've used a mvc based on https://www.udemy.com/course/php-mvc-from-scratch/ and following it with https://www.udemy.com/course/php-mvc-login/ course
